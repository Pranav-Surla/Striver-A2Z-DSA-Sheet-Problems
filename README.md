# üìö Striver's A2Z DSA Course ‚Äì Non-Platform Problem Solutions

Welcome to the repository containing **solutions to selected problems** from [Striver's A2Z DSA Course](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/), focusing **only on the problems that are not directly hosted on coding platforms** like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, CodeStudio, etc.

This course contains a well-curated list of **455 problems** aimed at building a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms. While most problems are available on competitive programming platforms, this repo is dedicated to the **rest of the problems** that require implementation, explanation, or are meant to be solved independently.
